# BUNK

Hello and welcome to your every day planner. 

If it wasn't clear from the title, this is a program to assist you responsibly skip class.  
It takes  **criterion as a command line argument**. The criterion  refers to *the percent of attendance you are aiming for*.  
  It also takes **user input** of *"Number of hours or sessions you had"* and *"Number of  hours or sessions you attended"*.  
The program **outputs**  your *current attendance percentage* and Number of days you can *afford to take leave according to your criterion* or Number of days you have to *continue attending to reach your required criterion* according to your attendeance percentage. 

This is my first project  and it is entirely written in **C programming language** so you can bet that it will be fast, on the other hand it is not that big on the UI front. Like I said this is my first project and I'm all ears to any ideas to improve it.


# BUNK for dummies

### LINUX
If you downloaded the LINUX version, congrats! You now get the version with possibly the better UI.
> **How to use**  
> Step 1: cd into the directory to which you downloaded the file.  
> Step 2: run the program with the command.
> **Command**: ./bunk criterion  

Obviously criterion is not "criterion" as in literally.  It is a number in the range 0 - 100.

>eg:  $ ./bunk 80

In this example 80 is my target attendance percentage. 


### WINDOWS
If you downloaded the WINDOWS version, don't worry; colors are overrated anyway.
> **How to use**  
> Step 1: open the folder to which u downloaded the file.  
> Step 2: click the [address bar](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwinaero.com%2Fblog%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F09%2FWindows-10-File-Explorer-Address-Bar-Full-Path.png&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwinaero.com%2Fshow-full-path-address-bar-windows-10-file-explorer%2F&tbnid=TcqOB1NcDGyd_M&vet=12ahUKEwivzOm2xqX7AhU-3TgGHQZ4CxoQMygIegUIARDTAQ..i&docid=EOIBikiDeV8htM&w=490&h=182&q=address%20bar%20in%20windows&client=opera-gx&ved=2ahUKEwivzOm2xqX7AhU-3TgGHQZ4CxoQMygIegUIARDTAQ) and clear everything. (Do not press enter)  
> Step 3: type "cmd" in the cleared address bar and hit enter.  
> Step 4: A command prompt terminal now opens where you have to type the command.  
> **Command** : bunk criterion

Obviously criterion is not "criterion" as in literally.  It is a number in the range 0 - 100.
>eg:  >bunk 80

In this example 80 is my target attendance percentage. 

## Terminal

Made it this far? Congratulations! 

Like I said the UI isn't that great and once you run the program you will be greeted by a window like this:
>        ***BUNK***
>          ______
>     1. CALCULATE
>     2. CREATE
>     3. LOAD
>     4. UPDATE
>     5. DELETE
>     6. EXIT
>     Enter your choice number:
Enter the "number" of your choice.

Everything else is pretty straight forward.

### FEATURES
First of all - you need to know that, if it not a bug then its a feature. You also need to know that if it is a bug then its still a feature.
> - **Calculate**:  
> It crunches the numbers and finds the result.  
> Note - You need to load your profile first.
> - **Create**:  
> It includes creation of your profile and insertion of data.
> - **Load**  
> It is used to load the profile if you already created one.
> - **Update**  
> It is used to update the data of an already existing profile.
> - **Delete**  
> It is used to delete a profile.
> - **Exit**  
> It is used to run the program jk, just checking if you are paying attention.  
> It does the normal thing.

It also has some overwrite warning features and what not but I'm not going to include that.  
Finally, if something happens which was not supposed to happen then CTRL + C is you friend.
